Dataset Composition and Structure

The dataset is divided into five distinct sets (A through E), with each set containing EEG data recorded under different conditions.
Each set consists of 100 single-channel EEG recordings, each lasting 23.6 seconds and sampled at 173.61 Hz (rounded to 174 Hz in many analyses).
The five sets can be categorized as follows:
Set A (Z): Contains recordings labeled "Z", which are EEG signals recorded from healthy subjects with eyes open. This state represents a normal and awake brain activity.
Set B (O): Contains recordings labeled "O", representing EEG signals from healthy subjects with eyes closed. The difference between eyes open and closed can affect brain wave activity, particularly in the alpha band.
Set C (N): Contains recordings labeled "N", representing interictal (non-seizure) EEG signals recorded from the epileptic zone in the brain of individuals with epilepsy. These are considered abnormal but not seizure-related.
Set D (F): Contains recordings labeled "F", which are interictal EEG signals from regions outside the epileptic zone. Although recorded from an epileptic patient, these signals are from non-epileptic regions.
Set E (S): Contains recordings labeled "S", representing ictal (seizure) EEG signals. These signals are recorded during actual seizure events and are strongly abnormal.

Contents of Each Folder:

Each folder contains 100 .txt files, where each file represents an individual EEG recording.

Each .txt file contains 4097 samples of EEG data.
These files store raw EEG signal data (one-dimensional) for a specific period.

In summary:

Set A (Z) and Set B (O) contain normal EEG signals (healthy individuals).
Set C (N) and Set D (F) contain abnormal signals from epileptic patients (non-seizure state).
Set E (S) contains seizure (ictal) EEG signals.
