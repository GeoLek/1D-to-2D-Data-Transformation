# Transforming-1-D-Machine-Learning-Problems-to-2-D-Towards-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks 
This is an endeavour to transform 1D Machine Learning problems to 2D towards using Convolutional Neural Networks. We will check various dimension transformation methods and evaluate their performance. 

# Used datasets
For ECG signals we will use the MMIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset from PhysioNet (Version: 1.0.0). Find them [here](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)  
For EEG signals we will use the Epilepsy EEG Dataset (University of Bonn). FInd them [here]([https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/](https://www.ukbonn.de/epileptologie/arbeitsgruppen/ag-lehnertz-neurophysik/downloads/))
